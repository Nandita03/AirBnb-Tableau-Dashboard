This project targets to visualize Airbnb 2016 data using Tableau and identifies various trends in terms of pricing, from which month demand of booking increases, which bedroom type gets booked the most, which location have the highest price etc. The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).

### Analysis

We can see from the line graph that while the average price of listings is largely stable throughout the year, there is a noteworthy uptick in May-June and after october that is probably caused due to holiday season. Also, the comparison of the costs of various room categories shows the average price per room type. It can also be concluded that the AirBnb in area with zipcode 98134 are more expensive compared to the other areas. These tips can be helpful for tourists who want to stick to a budget and for hosts who want to improve their pricing tactics.
